# GridAnimator

### Problem Statement

Create a grid of elements that fill the entire screen(grid size would be affected by the size of each element) both in portrait and landscape mode.
Touching a grid element would result in it being deleted from the grid. The deletion would use a flip animation.
Auto adjust all other elements to take the space of the deleted element. They should animate into their correct position.
The animation speed and the size of grid elements and spacing between elements should be configurable. This can either be defined as modifiable constants or as a configuration screen when we launch the app where we set these properties and go to the grid from there.
It is safe to assume that the app will be Marshmallow and above

Feel free to make any assumptions if something is not clear but let us know about them, once you deliver the code.
